# v1.22 Pending Release Notes

Notes for the v1.22.0 release, including breaking changes and new features.
Changes should *not* be included here if they are backported to previous releases.

## Breaking Changes


## Features

- Ceph exporters automatically skip fetching monitor configuration at startup when the
  `rook-config-override` configmap sets `global.ms_public_type` to `async+rdma`.

- `CephObjectStoreUser` gained `spec.secretTemplate`, which adds labels and annotations to the Secret that holds the
  user's credentials, for example to opt the Secret in to a tool that copies Secrets into other namespaces. Keys that
  Rook sets or acts on are reserved.
- RGW SSE-S3 accepts `VAULT_TRANSIT_BACKEND_PATH` in `security.s3.connectionDetails` for a Vault transit engine that is
  not mounted at the default `transit` path. RGW SSE-KMS with the `transit` engine accepts it in
  `security.kms.connectionDetails` too.
