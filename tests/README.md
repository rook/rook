# Rook Test Framework

The Rook Test Framework is used to run end to end and integration tests on Rook. The framework depends on a running instance of Kubernetes.
The framework also provides scripts for starting Kubernetes so users can
quickly spin up a Kubernetes cluster. The Test framework is designed to install Rook, run tests, and uninstall Rook.

## Install Kubernetes

You can choose any Kubernetes install of your choice.  The test framework only depends on `kubectl` being configured.
An optional helper script is provided to install Kubernetes with minikube.

### Minikube

Starting the cluster on Minikube is as simple as running:

```console
tests/scripts/minikube.sh up
```

To copy Rook images generated from your local build into the Minikube VM, run the following commands after `minikube.sh up` succeeded:

```console
tests/scripts/minikube.sh update
tests/scripts/minikube.sh helm
```

Stopping the cluster and destroying the Minikube VM can be done with:

```console
tests/scripts/minikube.sh clean
```

For faster iteration during development, take a snapshot of the fresh minikube VM and then reset
the VM each time you need a clean environment.

## Install Helm

Use [helm.sh](/tests/scripts/helm.sh) to install Helm and set up Rook charts defined under `_output/charts` (generated by build):

- To install and set up Helm charts for Rook run `tests/scripts/helm.sh up`.
- To clean up `tests/scripts/helm.sh clean`.

**NOTE:** These helper scripts depend on some artifacts under the `_output/` directory generated during build time.
These scripts should be run from the project root. e.g., `tests/script/minikube.sh up`.

**NOTE**: If Helm is not available in your `PATH`, Helm will be downloaded to a temporary directory (`/tmp/rook-tests-scripts-helm`) and used from that directory.

## Run Tests

From the project root do the following after bringing up your Kubernetes cluster such as minikube:

### 1. Build rook

`make build`

### 2. Start Kubernetes

Start the minikube cluster and copy the local build into minikube:

```console
tests/scripts/minikube.sh up
```

### 3. Run integration tests

Some settings are available to run the tests under different environments. The settings are all configured with environment variables.
See [environment.go](/tests/framework/installer/environment.go) for the available environment variables.
At least you should set the following variables.

```console
export TEST_HELM_PATH=/tmp/rook-tests-scripts-helm/linux-amd64/helm
export TEST_BASE_DIR=WORKING_DIR
export TEST_SCRATCH_DEVICE=<block device> # for example, TEST_SCRATCH_DEVICE=/dev/sdb
```

Please note that the integration tests erase the contents of TEST_SCRATCH_DEVICE.

To run all integration tests:

```console
go test -v -timeout 7200s github.com/rook/rook/tests/integration
```

After running tests, you can get test logs under "tests/integration/_output".

To run a specific suite (uses regex):

```console
go test -v -timeout 1800s -run CephSmokeSuite github.com/rook/rook/tests/integration
```

To run specific tests inside a suite:

```console
go test -v -timeout 1800s -run CephSmokeSuite github.com/rook/rook/tests/integration -testify.m TestARookClusterInstallation_SmokeTest
```

By default, the test cluster is not cleaned after the integration test execution if it fails. If you want to force the cluster cleanup after test execution independently of the execution result, set the following env var:

```console
export FORCE_CLUSTER_CLEANUP=true
```

### To run tests on OpenShift environment

- Setup OpenShift environment and export KUBECONFIG before executing the tests.
- Make sure `oc` executable file is in the PATH.
- Only `CephSmokeSuite` is currently supported on OpenShift.
- Set few environment variables:

```console
export TEST_ENV_NAME=openshift
export TEST_STORAGE_CLASS=gp2
export TEST_BASE_DIR=/tmp
export RETRY_MAX=40
```

To run the `CephSmokeSuite`:

```console
go test -v -timeout 1800s -run CephSmokeSuite github.com/rook/rook/tests/integration
```
