# Gopkg.toml 
#
# Add constraints for packages that are a direct dependency
# of this project (i.e. they are imported by golang source code)
# and you want to ensure that only a specific version is needed.
# if you don't need a specific version don't add the constraint here.
# Constraints are of the form:
#
# [[constraint]]
#   name = "github.com/user/project"
#   version = "1.0.0"
#
# [[constraint]]
#   name = "github.com/user/project2"
#   revision = "8991bc29aa16c548c550c7ff78260e27b9ab7c73"
#
# revision constraints are preferred to version constraints.
#
# add overrides for packages that are not used directly but
# you want to ensure that are at a specific version. for example,
#
# [[override]]
#  name = "github.com/x/y"
#  version = "2.4.0"
