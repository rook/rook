# Handling node drains through managed PodDisruptionBudgets.

## Goals

- Handle and block node drains that would cause data unavailability and loss.
- Unblock drains dynamically so that a rolling upgrade is made possible.
- Allow for rolling upgrade of nodes in automated kubernetes environments like [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)



## Design

### OSDs

OSDs do not fit under the single PodDisruptionBudget pattern. Ceph's ability to tolerate pod disruptions in one failure domain is dependent on the overall health of the cluster.
Even if an upgrade agent were only to drain one node at a time, Ceph would have to wait until there were no undersized PGs before moving on the next.

The failure domain will be determined by the smallest failure domain of all the Ceph Pools in that cluster.

#### Types of OSD PDBs:
- `Default` PDB:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - Named as `rook-ceph-osd`
    - It allows one healthy OSD to go down, by setting `maxUnavailable=1`, on any failure domain.
    - Sometimes one or more OSDs can be down (disk failure, etc) without any node drain but PGs would still be `active+clean`. In that case, the `maxUnavailable` is set to `1+number of down OSDs`
=======
    - Named `rook-ceph-osd`
    - Allows one healthy OSD to go down by setting `maxUnavailable=1` on any failure domain.
    - Sometimes one or more OSDs might down (non-overlapping drive failures, for example) without any node drained, but PGs are still `active+clean`. In that case, the downed OSDs are excluded from the PDB through label match expressions.
>>>>>>> 60a15306e (osd: exclude down OSDs from main PDB when cluster is clean)
- `Blocking` PDBs
    - Named as `rook-ceph-osd-<failureDomainType>-<FailureDomainName>`. For example: `rook-ceph-osd-zone-zone-a`
    - These PDBs are created on the entire failure domain.
    - `maxUnavailable` is set to 0 to prevent any OSD pod from draining.

We begin with creating the default PodDisruptionBudget for all the OSDs. Once the user drains a node and an OSD goes down, we determine the failure domain for the draining OSD (using the OSD deployment labels). Then we create blocking PodDisruptionBudgets (maxUnavailable=0) for all other failure domains and delete the main PodDisruptionBudget. This blocks OSDs from going down in multiple failure domains simultaneously.

Once the drained OSDs are back and all the pgs are active+clean, that is, the cluster is healed, the default PodDisruptionBudget is added back and the blocking ones are deleted.

#### Detecting Node Drains:
Detecting drains is not easy as they are a client side operation. The client cordons the node and continuously attempts to evict all pods from the node until it succeeds. If a node on which the OSD is suppose to run, is `unscheduleable` then the operator considers that node to be draining.

#### Example scenario:

- Zone x
  - Node a
    - osd.0
    - osd.1
- Zone y
  - Node b
    - osd.2
    - osd.3
- Zone z
  - Node c
    - osd.4
    - osd.5

1. A default PDB `rook-ceph-osd`, with maxUnavailable=1, is created for all OSDs.
2. User drains `Node a` for maintenance
3. Operator notices that an OSD has gone down (for example, `osd.0` on `Node a` and `Zone x`):
   - Creates a blocking PDBs `rook-ceph-osd-zone-zone-y` and `rook-ceph-osd-zone-zone-z`
   - Deletes the default PDB that covers all OSDs
   - Now all remaining OSDs in zone x would be allowed to be drained
4. When `Node-a` is back, all of its OSDs are running and all PGs are `active+clean`:
   - Restores the default PDB `rook-ceph-osd` (maxUnavailable=1)
   - Deletes the blocking PDBs `rook-ceph-osd-zone-zone-y` and `rook-ceph-osd-zone-zone-z`

An example of an operator that will attempt to do rolling upgrades of nodes is the Machine Config Operator in openshift. Based on what I have seen in
[SIG cluster lifecycle](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle), kubernetes deployments based on cluster-api approach will be
a common way of deploying kubernetes. This will also work to mitigate manual drains from accidentally disrupting storage.


#### Preventing unnecessary data migration:
- If a node is down due to planned maintenance, we don't want the data of the drained OSDs to be migrated to other OSDs.
- Operator adds `noout` flag to the failure domain on which the node was drained.
- This `noout` is removed after `OSDMaintenanceTimeout` is elapsed. `OSDMaintenanceTimeout` defaults to 30 minutes but can be configured from the cephCluster CR.
- `noout` is not added if the OSD is down but there is no node drain.

#### OSDs down due to reasons other than node drain:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- OSDs can be down due to various reasons other than a node drain event. For example, disk failure.
- If the PGs are active+clean even after the OSDs are down, then the operator will update the `maxUnavailable` count to `1+number of down OSDs` in the main PDB.
=======
- OSDs may be down for other reasons, e.g. drive failure.
- If all PGs are `active+clean` despite `down` OSD, the Rook operator will exclude the down OSDs in the main PDB like so (assume OSDs 1,3,5 are down):
```yaml
  maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: app
        operator: In
        values: ["rook-ceph-osd"]
      - key: osd
        operator: NotIn
        values: ["1", "3", "5"]
```
>>>>>>> 60a15306e (osd: exclude down OSDs from main PDB when cluster is clean)
- This will allow other healthy OSDs to be drained.

### Mon, Mgr, MDS, RGW, RBDMirror

Since there is no strict failure domain requirement for each of these, and they are not logically grouped, a static PDB will suffice.

A single PodDisruptionBudget is created and owned by the respective controllers, and updated only according to changes in the CRDs that change the amount of pods.

Eg: For a 3 Mon configuration, we can have PDB with the same labelSelector as the Deployment and have maxUnavailable as 1.
If the mon count is increased to 5, we can replace it with a PDB that has maxUnavailable set to 2.
