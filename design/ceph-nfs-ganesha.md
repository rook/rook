# Ceph NFS-Ganesha CRD

[NFS-Ganesha] is a user space NFS server that is well integrated with [CephFS]
and [RGW] backends. It can export Ceph's filesystem namespaces and Object
gateway namespaces over NFSv4 protocol.

Rook already orchestrates Ceph filesytem and Object store (or RGW) on
Kubernetes (k8s). It can be extended to orchestrate NFS-Ganesha server daemons
as highly available and  scalable NFS gateway pods to the Ceph filesytem and
Object Store. This will allow NFS client applications to use the Ceph filesytem
and object store setup by rook.

This feature mainly differs from the feature to add NFS as an another
storage backend for rook (the general NFS solution) in the following ways:

* It will use the rook's Ceph operator and not a separate NFS operator to
  deploy the NFS server pods.

* The NFS server pods will be directly configured with CephFS or RGW
  backend setup by rook, and will not require CephFS or RGW to be mounted
  in the NFS server pod with a PVC.

## Design of Ceph NFS-Ganesha CRD

The NFS-Ganesha server settings will be exposed to Rook as a
Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Creating the nfs-ganesha CRD will launch
a cluster of NFS-Ganesha server pods that will be configured with no exports.

The NFS client recovery data will be stored in a Ceph RADOS pool; and
the servers will have stable IP addresses by using [k8s Service].
Export management will be done by updating a per-pod config file object
in RADOS by external tools and issuing dbus commands to the server to
reread the configuration.

This allows the NFS-Ganesha server cluster to be scalable and highly available.

### Prerequisites

- A running rook Ceph filesystem or object store, whose namespaces will be
  exported by the NFS-Ganesha server cluster.
  e.g.,
  ```
  kubectl create -f cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/filesystem.yaml
  ```

- An existing RADOS pool (e.g., CephFS's data pool) or a pool created with a
  [Ceph Pool CRD] to store NFS client recovery data.


### Ceph NFS-Ganesha CRD

The NFS-Ganesha CRD will specify the following:

- Number of active Ganesha servers in the cluster

- Placement of the Ganesha servers

- Resource limits (memory, CPU) of the Ganesha server pods

- RADOS pool and namespace where backend objects will be stored (supplemental
  config objects and recovery backend objects)


Below is an example NFS-Ganesha CRD, `nfs-ganesha.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephNFS
metadata:
  # The name of Ganesha server cluster to create. It will be reflected in
  # the name(s) of the ganesha server pod(s)
  name: mynfs
  # The namespace of the Rook cluster where the Ganesha server cluster is
  # created.
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  # NFS client recovery storage settings
  rados:
    # RADOS pool where NFS client recovery data and per-daemon configs are
    # stored. In this example the data pool for the "myfs" filesystem is used.
    # If using the object store example, the data pool would be
    # "my-store.rgw.buckets.data". Note that this has nothing to do with where
    # exported CephFS' or objectstores live.
    pool: myfs-data0
    # RADOS namespace where NFS client recovery data and per-daemon configs are
    # stored.
    namespace: ganesha-ns

  # Settings for the ganesha server
  server:
    # the number of active ganesha servers
    active: 3
    # where to run the nfs ganesha server
    placement:
    #  nodeAffinity:
    #    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    #      nodeSelectorTerms:
    #      - matchExpressions:
    #        - key: role
    #          operator: In
    #          values:
    #          - mds-node
    #  tolerations:
    #  - key: mds-node
    #    operator: Exists
    #  podAffinity:
    #  podAntiAffinity:
    # The requests and limits set here allow the ganesha pod(s) to use half of
    # one CPU core and 1 gigabyte of memory
    resources:
    #  limits:
    #    cpu: "500m"
    #    memory: "1024Mi"
    #  requests:
    #    cpu: "500m"
    #    memory: "1024Mi"
```

When the  nfs-ganesha.yaml is created the following will happen:

- Rook's Ceph operator sees the creation of the NFS-Ganesha CRD.

- The operator creates as many [k8s Deployments] as the number of active
  Ganesha servers mentioned in the CRD. Each deployment brings up a Ganesha
  server pod, a replicaset of size 1.

- The ganesha servers, each running in a separate pod, use a mostly-identical
  ganesha config (ganesha.conf) with no EXPORT definitions. The end of the
  file will have it do a %url include on a pod-specific RADOS object from which
  it reads the rest of its config.

- The operator creates a k8s service for each of the ganesha server pods
  to allow each of the them to have a stable IP address.

The ganesha server pods constitute an active-active high availability NFS
server cluster. If one of the active Ganesha server pods goes down, k8s brings
up a replacement ganesha server pod with the same configuration and IP address.
The NFS server cluster can be scaled up or down by updating the
number of the active Ganesha servers in the CRD (using `kubectl edit` or
modifying the original CRD and running `kubectl apply -f <CRD yaml file>`).

### Per-node config files
After loading the basic ganesha config from inside the container, the node
will read the rest of its config from an object in RADOS. This allows external
tools to generate EXPORT definitions for ganesha.

The object will be named "conf-<metadata.name>.<index>", where metadata.name
is taken from the CRD and the index is internally generated. It will be stored
in `rados.pool` and `rados.namespace` from the above CRD.

### Consuming the NFS shares

An external consumer will fetch the ganesha server IPs by querying the k8s
services of the Ganesha server pods. It should have network access to the
Ganesha pods to manually mount the shares using a NFS client. Later, support
will be added to allow user pods to easily consume the NFS shares via PVCs.

## Example use-case

The NFS shares exported by rook's ganesha server pods can be consumed by
[OpenStack] cloud's user VMs. To do this, OpenStack's shared file system
service, [Manila] will provision NFS shares backed by CephFS using rook.
Manila's [CephFS driver] will create NFS-Ganesha CRDs to launch ganesha server
pods. The driver will dynamically add or remove exports of the ganesha server
pods based on OpenStack users' requests. The OpenStack user VMs will have
network connectivity to the ganesha server pods, and manually mount the shares
using NFS clients.
