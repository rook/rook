# Ceph Object Bucket Claim

Rook supports the creation of new buckets and access to existing buckets via two custom resources:

- an `Object Bucket Claim (OBC)` is custom resource which requests a bucket (new or existing) and is described by a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) shown below.
- an `Object Bucket (OB)` is a custom resource automatically generated when a bucket is provisioned. It is a global resource, typically not visible to non-admin users, and contains information specific to the bucket. It is described by an OB CRD, also shown below.

An OBC references a storage class which is created by an administrator. The storage class defines whether the bucket requested is a new bucket or an existing bucket. It also defines the bucket retention policy.
Users request a new or existing bucket by creating an OBC which is shown below. The ceph provisioner detects the OBC and creates a new bucket or grants access to an existing bucket, depending the the storage class referenced in the OBC. It also generates a Secret which provides credentials to access the bucket, and a ConfigMap which contains the bucket's endpoint. Application pods consume the information in the Secret and ConfigMap to access the bucket

## Sample

### OBC Custom Resource
```yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucketClaim
metadata:
  name: ceph-bucket [1]
  namespace: rook-ceph [2]
spec:
  bucketName: [3]
  generateBucketName: photo-booth [4]
  storageClassName: rook-ceph-bucket [4]
  additionalConfig: [5]
    ANY_KEY: VALUE ...
```
1. `name` of the `ObjectBucketClaim`. This name becomes the name of the Secret and ConfigMap.
1. `namespace`(optional) of the `ObjectBucketClaim`, which is also the namespace of the ConfigMap and Secret.
1. `bucketName` name of the `bucket`.
**Not** recommended for new buckets since names must be unique within
an entire object store.
1. `generateBucketName` value becomes the prefix for a randomly generated name, if supplied then `bucketName` must be empty.
If both `bucketName` and `generateBucketName` are supplied then `BucketName` has precedence and `GenerateBucketName` is ignored.
If both `bucketName` and `generateBucketName` are blank or omitted then the storage class is expected to contain the name of an _existing_ bucket. It's an error if all three bucket related names are blank or omitted.
1. `storageClassName` which defines the StorageClass which contains the names of the bucket provisioner, the object-store and specifies the bucket retention policy.
1. `additionalConfig` is an optional list of key-value pairs used to define attributes specific to the bucket being provisioned by this OBC. This information is typically tuned to a particular bucket provisioner and may limit application portability. Examples can include config values such as tenant, user and policy settings, etc.

### OBC Custom Resource after Bucket Provisioning
```yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucketClaim
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-10-18T09:54:01Z"
  generation: 2
  name: ceph-bucket
  namespace: default [1]
  resourceVersion: "559491"
spec:
  ObjectBucketName: obc-default-ceph-bucket [2]
  additionalConfig: null
  bucketName: photo-booth-c1178d61-1517-431f-8408-ec4c9fa50bee [3]
  cannedBucketAcl: ""
  ssl: false
  storageClassName: rook-ceph-bucket [4]
  versioned: false
status:
  Phase: bound [5]
```
1. `namespace` where OBC got created.
1. `ObjectBucketName` generated OB name created using name space and OBC name.
1. the generated (in this case), unique `bucket name` for the new bucket.
1. name of the storage class from OBC got created.
1. phases of bucket creation:
    - _Pending_: the operator is processing the request.
    - _Bound_: the operator finished processing the request and linked the OBC and OB
    - _Released_: the OB has been deleted, leaving the OBC unclaimed but unavailable.
    - _Failed_: not currently set.

### App Pod
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
  namespace: dev-user
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: redis
    envFrom: [1]
    - configMapRef:
        name: ceph-bucket [2]
    - secretRef:
        name: ceph-bucket [3]
```
1. use `env:` if mapping of the defined key names to the env var names used by the app is needed.
1. makes available to the pod as env variables: `BUCKET_HOST`, `BUCKET_PORT`, `BUCKET_NAME`
1. makes available to the pod as env variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### StorageClass
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-bucket
  labels:
    aws-s3/object [1]
provisioner: ceph.rook.io/bucket [2]
parameters: [3]
  objectStoreName: my-store
  objectStoreNamespace: rook-ceph
  region: us-west-1
  bucketName: ceph-bucket [4]
reclaimPolicy: Delete [5]
```
1. `label`(optional) here associates this `StorageClass` to a specific provisioner.
1. `provisioner` responsible for handling `OBCs` referencing this `StorageClass`.
1. **all** `parameter` required.
1. `bucketName` is required for access to existing buckets but is omitted when provisioning new buckets.
Unlike greenfield provisioning, the brownfield bucket name appears in the `StorageClass`, not the `OBC`.
1. rook-ceph provisioner decides how to treat the `reclaimPolicy` when an `OBC` is deleted for the bucket. See explanation as [specified in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#retain)
+ _Delete_ = physically delete the bucket.
+ _Retain_ = do not physically delete the bucket.
