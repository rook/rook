Rook allows exporting NFS shares of a CephFilesystem or CephObjectStore through the CephNFS custom
resource definition.

## NFS Settings

### Server

The `server` spec sets configuration for Rook-created NFS-Ganesha server pods.

* `active`: The number of active NFS servers. Rook supports creating more than one active NFS
    server, but cannot guarantee high availability. For values greater than 1, see the
    [known issue](#serveractive-count-greater-than-1) below.
* `placement`: Kubernetes placement restrictions to apply to NFS server Pod(s). This is similar to
    placement defined for daemons configured by the
    [CephCluster CRD](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/deploy/examples/cluster.yaml).
* `annotations`: Kubernetes annotations to apply to NFS server Pod(s)
* `labels`: Kubernetes labels to apply to NFS server Pod(s)
* `resources`: Kubernetes resource requests and limits to set on NFS server containers
* `priorityClassName`: Set priority class name for the NFS server Pod(s)
* `logLevel`: The log level that NFS-Ganesha servers should output.</br>
    Default value: `NIV_INFO`</br>
    Supported values: `NIV_NULL | NIV_FATAL | NIV_MAJ | NIV_CRIT | NIV_WARN | NIV_EVENT | NIV_INFO | NIV_DEBUG | NIV_MID_DEBUG | NIV_FULL_DEBUG | NB_LOG_LEVEL`
* `hostNetwork`: Whether host networking is enabled for the NFS server pod(s). If not set, the network
    settings from the CephCluster CR will be applied.

### Security

The `security` spec sets security configuration for the NFS cluster.

*   `kerberos`: Kerberos configures NFS-Ganesha to secure NFS client connections with Kerberos.
    *   `principalName`: this value is combined with (a) the namespace and name of the CephNFS (with a
        hyphen between) and (b) the Realm configured in the user-provided kerberos config file(s) to
        determine the full service principal name: `<principalName>/<namespace>-<name>@<realm>`.
        e.g., nfs/rook-ceph-my-nfs@example.net. For full details, see the
        [NFS security doc](../Storage-Configuration/NFS/nfs-security.md#nfs-service-principals).
    *   `domainName`: this is the domain name used in the kerberos credentials. This is used to
        configure idmap to map the kerberos credentials to uid/gid. Without this configured, NFS-Ganesha
        will use the anonuid/anongid configured (default: -2) when accessing the local filesystem.
        eg., DOMAIN1.EXAMPLE.COM.
        [NFS security doc](../Storage-Configuration/NFS/nfs-security.md#kerberos-domain-name).
    *   `configFiles`: defines where the Kerberos configuration should be sourced from. Config
        files will be placed into the `/etc/krb5.conf.rook/` directory. For advanced usage, see the
        [NFS security doc](../Storage-Configuration/NFS/nfs-security.md#kerberos-configuration).
        *   `volumeSource`: this is a standard Kubernetes VolumeSource for Kerberos configuration files
            like what is normally used to configure Volumes for a Pod. For example, a ConfigMap, Secret,
            or HostPath. The volume may contain multiple files, all of which will be loaded.
    *   `keytabFile`: defines where the Kerberos keytab should be sourced from. The keytab file will be
        placed into `/etc/krb5.keytab`. For advanced usage, see the
        [NFS security doc](../Storage-Configuration/NFS/nfs-security.md#kerberos-configuration).
        *   `volumeSource`: this is a standard Kubernetes VolumeSource for the Kerberos keytab file like
            what is normally used to configure Volumes for a Pod. For example, a Secret or HostPath.

            There are two requirements for the source's content:

            1. The config file must be mountable via `subPath: krb5.keytab`. For example, in a Secret, the
                data item must be named `krb5.keytab`, or `items` must be defined to select the key and
                give it path `krb5.keytab`. A HostPath directory must have the `krb5.keytab` file.
            2. The volume or config file must have mode 0600.

*   `sssd`: SSSD enables integration with System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). See also:
    [ID mapping via SSSD](../Storage-Configuration/NFS/nfs-security.md#id-mapping-via-sssd).
    *   `sidecar`: Specifying this configuration tells Rook to run SSSD in a sidecar alongside the NFS
        server in each NFS pod.
        *   `image`: defines the container image that should be used for the SSSD sidecar.
        *   `sssdConfigFile`: defines where the SSSD configuration should be sourced from. The
            config file will be placed into `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`. For advanced usage, see the
            [NFS security doc](../Storage-Configuration/NFS/nfs-security.md#sssd-configuration).
        *   `volumeSource`: this is a standard Kubernetes
            [VolumeSource](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#VolumeSource) like what is normally
            used to configure Volumes for a Pod. For example, a ConfigMap, Secret, or HostPath.
            There are two requirements for the source's content:
            1.  The config file must be mountable via `subPath: sssd.conf`. For example, in a ConfigMap,
                the data item must be named `sssd.conf`, or `items` must be defined to select the key and
                give it path `sssd.conf`. A HostPath directory must have the `sssd.conf` file.
            2.  The volume or config file must have mode 0600.
        *   `additionalFiles`: adds any number of additional files into the SSSD sidecar. All files will
            be placed into `/etc/sssd/rook-additional/<subPath>` and can be referenced by the SSSD
            config file. For example, CA and/or TLS certificates to authenticate with Kerberos.
            -   `subPath`: the sub-path of `/etc/sssd/rook-additional` to add files into. This can
                include `/` to create arbitrarily deep sub-paths if desired. If the `volumeSource` is a
                file, this will refer to a file name.
            -   `volumeSource`: this is a standard Kubernetes VolumeSource for additional files like what is
                normally used to configure Volumes for a Pod. For example, a ConfigMap, Secret, or HostPath.
                The volume may contain multiple files, a single file, or may be a file on its own (e.g., a
                host path with `type: File`).
        *   `debugLevel`: sets the debug level for SSSD. If unset or `0`, Rook does nothing. Otherwise,
            this may be a value between 1 and 10. See the
            [SSSD docs](https://sssd.io/troubleshooting/basics.html#sssd-debug-logs) for more info.
        *   `resources`: Kubernetes resource requests and limits to set on NFS server containers

## Scaling the active server count

It is possible to scale the size of the cluster up or down by modifying the `spec.server.active`
field. Scaling the cluster size up can be done at will. Once the new server comes up, clients can be
assigned to it immediately.

The CRD always eliminates the highest index servers first, in reverse order from how they were
started. Scaling down the cluster requires that clients be migrated from servers that will be
eliminated to others. That process is currently a manual one and should be performed before reducing
the size of the cluster.

!!! warning
    See the [known issue](#serveractive-count-greater-than-1) below about setting this
    value greater than one.


## Known issues

### server.active count greater than 1

* Active-active scale out does not work well with the NFS protocol. If one NFS server in a cluster
    is offline, other servers may block client requests until the offline server returns, which may
    not always happen due to the Kubernetes scheduler.
    * Workaround: It is safest to run only a single NFS server, but we do not limit this if it
        benefits your use case.

### Ceph v17.2.1

* Ceph NFS management with the Rook mgr module enabled has a breaking regression with the Ceph
    Quincy v17.2.1 release.
    * Workaround: Leave Ceph's Rook orchestrator mgr module disabled. If you have enabled it, you must
        disable it using the snippet below from the toolbox.

        ```console
        ceph orch set backend ""
        ceph mgr module disable rook
        ```
