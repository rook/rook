title: Object Multisite CRDs
---

The following CRDs enable Ceph object stores to isolate or replicate data via multisite. For more information on multisite, visit the [Ceph Object Multisite CRDs documentation](../../Storage-Configuration/Object-Storage-RGW/ceph-object-multisite.md).

## Ceph Object Realm CRD

Rook allows creation of a realm in a ceph cluster for object stores through the custom resource definitions (CRDs). The following settings are available for Ceph object store realms.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephObjectRealm
metadata:
  name: realm-a
  namespace: rook-ceph
# This endpoint in this section needs is an endpoint from the master zone  in the master zone group of realm-a. See object-multisite.md for more details.
spec:
  pull:
    endpoint: http://10.2.105.133:80
```

### Object Realm Settings

#### Metadata

* `name`: The name of the object realm to create
* `namespace`: The namespace of the Rook cluster where the object realm is created.

#### Spec

* `pull`: This optional section is for the pulling the realm for another ceph cluster.
  * `endpoint`: The endpoint in the realm from another ceph cluster you want to pull from. This endpoint must be in the master zone of the master zone group of the realm.

## Ceph Object Zone Group CRD

Rook allows creation of zone groups in a ceph cluster for object stores through the custom resource definitions (CRDs). The following settings are available for Ceph object store zone groups.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephObjectZoneGroup
metadata:
  name: zonegroup-a
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  realm: realm-a
```

### Object Zone Group Settings

#### Metadata

* `name`: The name of the object zone group to create
* `namespace`: The namespace of the Rook cluster where the object zone group is created.

#### Spec

* `realm`: The object realm in which the zone group will be created. This matches the name of the object realm CRD.

## Ceph Object Zone CRD

Rook allows creation of zones in a ceph cluster for object stores through the custom resource definitions (CRDs). The following settings are available for Ceph object store zone.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephObjectZone
metadata:
  name: zone-a
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  zoneGroup: zonegroup-a
  metadataPool:
    failureDomain: host
    replicated:
      size: 3
  dataPool:
    failureDomain: osd
    erasureCoded:
      dataChunks: 2
      codingChunks: 1
  customEndpoints:
    - "http://rgw-a.fqdn"
```

### Object Zone Settings

#### Metadata

* `name`: The name of the object zone to create
* `namespace`: The namespace of the Rook cluster where the object zone is created.

### Pools

The pools allow all of the settings defined in the Pool CRD spec. For more details, see the [Pool CRD](../Block-Storage/ceph-block-pool-crd.md) settings. In the example above, there must be at least three hosts (size 3) and at least three devices (2 data + 1 coding chunks) in the cluster.

#### Spec

* `zonegroup`: The object zonegroup in which the zone will be created. This matches the name of the object zone group CRD.
* `metadataPool`: The settings used to create all of the object store metadata pools. Must use replication.
* `dataPool`: The settings to create the object store data pool. Can use replication or erasure coding.
* `customEndpoints`:  Specify the endpoint(s) that will accept multisite replication traffic for this zone. You may include the port in the definition if necessary. For example: "https://my-object-store.my-domain.net:443". By default, Rook will set this to the DNS name of the ClusterIP Service created for the CephObjectStore that corresponds to this zone.

 Most multisite configurations will not exist within the same Kubernetes cluster, meaning the default value will not be useful. In these cases, you will be required to create your own custom ingress resource for the CephObjectStore in order to make the zone available for replication. You must add the endpoint for your custom ingress resource to this list to allow the store to accept replication traffic.

 In the case of multiple stores (or multiple endpoints for a single store), you are not required to put all endpoints in this list. Only specify the endpoints that should be used for replication traffic.

 If you update `customEndpoints` to return to an empty list, you must the Rook operator to automatically add the CephObjectStore service endpoint to Ceph's internal configuration.
