# Monitoring

Each Rook Ceph cluster has some built in metrics collectors/exporters for monitoring with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
If you do not have Prometheus running, follow the steps below to enable monitoring of Rook. If your cluster already
contains a Prometheus instance, it will automatically discover Rooks scrape endpoint using the standard
`prometheus.io/scrape` and `prometheus.io/port` annotations.


## Prometheus Operator

First the Prometheus operator needs to be started in the cluster so it can watch for our requests to start monitoring Rook and respond by deploying the correct Prometheus pods and configuration.
A full explanation can be found in the [Prometheus operator repository on GitHub](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator), but the quick instructions can be found here:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/v0.26.0/bundle.yaml
```
This will start the Prometheus operator, but before moving on, wait until the operator is in the `Running` state:
```bash
kubectl get pod
```
Once the Prometheus operator is in the `Running` state, proceed to the next section.

## Prometheus Instances

With the Prometheus operator running, we can create a service monitor that will watch the Rook cluster and collect metrics regularly.
From the root of your locally cloned Rook repo, go the monitoring directory:
```bash
cd cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/monitoring
```

Create the service monitor as well as the Prometheus server pod and service:
```bash
kubectl create -f service-monitor.yaml
kubectl create -f prometheus.yaml
kubectl create -f prometheus-service.yaml
```

Ensure that the Prometheus server pod gets created and advances to the `Running` state before moving on:
```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod prometheus-rook-prometheus-0
```

## Prometheus Web Console

Once the Prometheus server is running, you can open a web browser and go to the URL that is output from this command:
```bash
echo "http://$(kubectl -n rook-ceph -o jsonpath={.status.hostIP} get pod prometheus-rook-prometheus-0):30900"
```

You should now see the Prometheus monitoring website.

Click on `Graph` in the top navigation bar.

In the dropdown that says `insert metric at cursor`, select any metric you would like to see, for example `ceph_cluster_total_used_bytes`

Click on the `Execute` button.

Below the `Execute` button, ensure the `Graph` tab is selected and you should now see a graph of your chosen metric over time.

## Prometheus Consoles
You can find Prometheus Consoles here: https://github.com/ceph/cephmetrics/tree/master/dashboards/current.
A guide to how you can write your own Prometheus consoles can be found on the official Prometheus site here: https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/consoles/.

## Grafana Dashboards
The dashboards have been created by [@galexrt](https://github.com/galexrt). For feedback on the dashboards please reach out to him on the [Rook.io Slack](https://slack.rook.io).

> **NOTE** The dashboards are only compatible with Grafana 5.0.3 or higher.

The following Grafana dashboards are available:
* [Ceph - Cluster](https://grafana.com/dashboards/2842)
* [Ceph - OSD](https://grafana.com/dashboards/5336)
* [Ceph - Pools](https://grafana.com/dashboards/5342)

## Teardown

To clean up all the artifacts created by the monitoring walkthrough, copy/paste the entire block below (note that errors about resources "not found" can be ignored):
```bash
kubectl delete -f service-monitor.yaml
kubectl delete -f prometheus.yaml
kubectl delete -f prometheus-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/v0.26.0/bundle.yaml
```
Then the rest of the instructions in the [Prometheus Operator docs](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator#removal) can be followed to finish cleaning up.

## Special Cases

### Tectonic Bare Metal
Tectonic strongly discourages the `tectonic-system` Prometheus instance to be used outside their intentions, so you need to create a new [Prometheus Operator](https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/) yourself.
After this you only need to create the service monitor as stated above.
