#  Rook Toolbox
The Rook toolbox is a container with common tools used for rook debugging and testing.
The toolbox is based on CentOS, so more tools of your choosing can be easily installed with `yum`.

## Running the Toolbox in Kubernetes

The rook toolbox can run as a pod in a Kubernetes cluster.  After you ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster with rook deployed (see the [Kubernetes](ceph-quickstart.md) instructions),
launch the rook-ceph-tools pod.

Save the tools spec as `toolbox.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-tools
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
  containers:
  - name: rook-ceph-tools
    image: rook/ceph-toolbox:master
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    env:
      - name: ROOK_ADMIN_SECRET
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: rook-ceph-mon
            key: admin-secret
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /dev
        name: dev
      - mountPath: /sys/bus
        name: sysbus
      - mountPath: /lib/modules
        name: libmodules
      - name: mon-endpoint-volume
        mountPath: /etc/rook
  # if hostNetwork: false, the "rbd map" command hangs, see https://github.com/rook/rook/issues/2021
  hostNetwork: true
  volumes:
    - name: dev
      hostPath:
        path: /dev
    - name: sysbus
      hostPath:
        path: /sys/bus
    - name: libmodules
      hostPath:
        path: /lib/modules
    - name: mon-endpoint-volume
      configMap:
        name: rook-ceph-mon-endpoints
        items:
        - key: data
          path: mon-endpoints
```

Launch the rook-ceph-tools pod:
```bash
kubectl create -f toolbox.yaml
```

Wait for the toolbox pod to download its container and get to the `running` state:
```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod rook-ceph-tools
```

Once the rook-ceph-tools pod is running, you can connect to it with:
```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it rook-ceph-tools bash
```

All available tools in the toolbox are ready for your troubleshooting needs.  Example:
```bash
ceph status
ceph osd status
ceph df
rados df
```

When you are done with the toolbox, remove the pod:
```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph delete pod rook-ceph-tools
```

## Troubleshooting without the Toolbox
The Ceph tools will commonly be the only tools needed to troubleshoot a cluster. In that case, you can connect to any of the rook pods and execute the ceph commands in the same way that you would in the toolbox pod such as the mon pods or the operator pod.
If connecting to the mon pods, make sure you connect to the mon most recently started. The mons keep the config updated in memory after starting and may not have the latest config on disk.
For example, after starting the cluster connect to the `mon2` pod instead of `mon0`.
