# Ceph Dashboard

The dashboard is a very helpful tool to give you an overview of the status of your Ceph cluster, including overall health,
status of the mon quorum, status of the mgr, osd, and other Ceph daemons, view pools and PG status, show logs for the daemons,
and more. Rook makes it simple to enable the dashboard.

## Enable the Ceph Dashboard

The [dashboard](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/mgr/dashboard/) can be enabled with settings in the CephCluster CRD. The CephCluster CRD must have the dashboard `enabled` setting set to `true`.
This is the default setting in the example manifests.

```yaml
  spec:
    dashboard:
      enabled: true
```

The Rook operator will enable the ceph-mgr dashboard module. A service object will be created to expose that port inside the Kubernetes cluster. Rook will
enable port 8443 for https access.

This example shows that port 8443 was configured.

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph get service
```

>```
>NAME                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
>rook-ceph-mgr                ClusterIP   10.108.111.192   <none>        9283/TCP         3h
>rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard      ClusterIP   10.110.113.240   <none>        8443/TCP         3h
>```

The first service is for reporting the [Prometheus metrics](ceph-monitoring.md), while the latter service is for the dashboard.
If you are on a node in the cluster, you will be able to connect to the dashboard by using either the
DNS name of the service at `https://rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard-https:8443` or by connecting to the cluster IP,
in this example at `https://10.110.113.240:8443`.

> **IMPORTANT:** Please note the dashboard will only be enabled for the first Ceph object store created by Rook.

### Login Credentials

After you connect to the dashboard you will need to login for secure access. Rook creates a default user named
`admin` and generates a secret called `rook-ceph-dashboard-admin-password` in the namespace where the Rook Ceph cluster is running.
To retrieve the generated password, you can run the following:

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph get secret rook-ceph-dashboard-password -o jsonpath="{['data']['password']}" | base64 --decode && echo
```

## Configure the Dashboard

The following dashboard configuration settings are supported:

```yaml
  spec:
    dashboard:
      urlPrefix: /ceph-dashboard
      port: 8443
      ssl: true
```

* `urlPrefix` If you are accessing the dashboard via a reverse proxy, you may
  wish to serve it under a URL prefix.  To get the dashboard to use hyperlinks
  that include your prefix, you can set the `urlPrefix` setting.
* `port` The port that the dashboard is served on may be changed from the
  default using the `port` setting. The corresponding K8s service exposing the
  port will automatically be updated.
* `ssl` The dashboard may be served without SSL (useful for when you deploy the
  dashboard behind a proxy already served using SSL) by setting the `ssl` option
  to be false.

## Viewing the Dashboard External to the Cluster

Commonly you will want to view the dashboard from outside the cluster. For example, on a development machine with the
cluster running inside minikube you will want to access the dashboard from the host.

There are several ways to expose a service that will depend on the environment you are running in.
You can use an [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) or [other methods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) for exposing services such as
NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalIPs.

### Node Port

The simplest way to expose the service in minikube or similar environment is using the NodePort to open a port on the
VM that can be accessed by the host. To create a service with the NodePort, save this yaml as `dashboard-external-https.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard-external-https
  namespace: rook-ceph
  labels:
    app: rook-ceph-mgr
    rook_cluster: rook-ceph
spec:
  ports:
  - name: dashboard
    port: 8443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app: rook-ceph-mgr
    rook_cluster: rook-ceph
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: NodePort
```

Now create the service:

```console
kubectl create -f dashboard-external-https.yaml
```

You will see the new service `rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard-external-https` created:

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph get service
```

>```
>NAME                                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
>rook-ceph-mgr                           ClusterIP   10.108.111.192   <none>        9283/TCP         4h
>rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard  this is long video b               ClusterIP   10.110.113.240   <none>        8443/TCP         4h
>rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard-external-https  NodePort    10.101.209.6     <none>        8443:31176/TCP   4h
>```

In this example, port `31176` will be opened to expose port `8443` from the ceph-mgr pod. Find the ip address
of the VM. If using minikube, you can run `minikube ip` to find the ip address.
Now you can enter the URL in your browser such as `https://192.168.99.110:31176` and the dashboard will appear.

### Load Balancer

If you have a cluster on a cloud provider that supports load balancers,
you can create a service that is provisioned with a public hostname.
The yaml is the same as `dashboard-external-https.yaml` except for the following property:

```yaml
spec:
[...]
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Now create the service:

```console
kubectl create -f dashboard-loadbalancer.yaml
```

You will see the new service `rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard-loadbalancer` created:

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph get service
```

>```
>NAME                                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)             AGE
>rook-ceph-mgr                            ClusterIP      172.30.11.40     <none>                                                                    9283/TCP            4h
>rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard                  ClusterIP      172.30.203.185   <none>                                                                    8443/TCP            4h
>rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard-loadbalancer     LoadBalancer   172.30.27.242    a7f23e8e2839511e9b7a5122b08f2038-1251669398.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   8443:32747/TCP      4h
>```

Now you can enter the URL in your browser such as `https://a7f23e8e2839511e9b7a5122b08f2038-1251669398.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8443` and the dashboard will appear.

### Ingress Controller

If you have a cluster with an [nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
and a Certificate Manager (e.g. [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/)) then you can create an
Ingress like the one below. This example achieves four things:

1. Exposes the dashboard on the Internet (using an reverse proxy)
2. Issues an valid TLS Certificate for the specified domain name (using [ACME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment))
3. Tells the reverse proxy that the dashboard itself uses HTTPS
4. Tells the reverse proxy that the dashboard itself does not have a valid certificate (it is self-signed)

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard
  namespace: rook-ceph
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |
      proxy_ssl_verify off;
spec:
  tls:
   - hosts:
     - rook-ceph.example.com
     secretName: rook-ceph.example.com
  rules:
  - host: rook-ceph.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard
          servicePort: https-dashboard
```

Customise the Ingress resource to match your cluster. Replace the example domain name `rook-ceph.example.com`
with a domain name that will resolve to your Ingress Controller (creating the DNS entry if required).

Now create the Ingress:

```console
kubectl create -f dashboard-ingress-https.yaml
```

You will see the new Ingress `rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard` created:

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph get ingress
```

>```
>NAME                      HOSTS                      ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE
>rook-ceph-mgr-dashboard   rook-ceph.example.com      80, 443   5m
>```

And the new Secret for the TLS certificate:

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph get secret rook-ceph.example.com
```

>```
>NAME                       TYPE                DATA      AGE
>rook-ceph.example.com      kubernetes.io/tls   2         4m
>```

You can now browse to `https://rook-ceph.example.com/` to log into the dashboard.
