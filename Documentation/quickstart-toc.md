# Quickstart Guides

Welcome to Rook! We hope you have a great experience installing the Rook storage platform to enable highly available, durable storage
in your cluster. If you have any questions along the way, please don't hesitate to ask us in our [Slack channel](https://rook-io.slack.com). You can sign up for our Slack [here](https://rook-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

Rook provides three types of storage providers to a Kubernetes cluster, each with its own operator to deploy and manage the cluster. Follow these guides to get started with each provider.

| Storage Provider | Status | Description |

| [Ceph](ceph-quickstart.md) | Beta | Ceph is a highly scalable distributed storage solution for block storage, object storage, and shared file systems with years of production deployments. |
| [CockroachDB](cockroachdb.md) | Alpha | CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.  |
| [Minio](minio-object-store.md) | Alpha | Minio is a high performance distributed object storage server, designed for large-scale private cloud infrastructure. |
