# Common Problems

Many of these problem cases are hard to summarize down to a short phrase that adequately describes the problem. Each problem will start with a bulleted list of symptoms. Keep in mind that all symptoms may not apply depending upon the configuration of the Rook. If the majority of the symptoms are seen there is a fair chance you are experiencing that problem.

If after trying the suggestions found on this page and the problem is not resolved, the Rook team is very happy to help you troubleshoot the issues in their Slack channel. Once you have [registered for the Rook Slack](https://rook-slackin.herokuapp.com/), proceed to the General channel to ask for assistance.

# Troubleshooting Techniques
One of the first things that should be done is to start the [rook-tools pod](./toolbox.md) as described in the Toolbox section. Once the pod is up and running one can `kubectl exec` into the pod to execute Ceph commands to evaluate that current state of the cluster. Here is a list of commands that can help one get an understanding of the current state.

* rookctl status
* ceph status
* ceph osd status
* ceph osd df
* ceph osd utilization
* ceph osd pool stats
* ceph osd tree
* ceph pg stat

Of particular note, the first two status commands provide the overall cluster health. The normal state for cluster operations is HEALTH_OK, but will still function when the state is in a HEALTH_WARN state. If you are in a WARN state, then the cluster is in a condition that it may enter the HEALTH_ERROR state at which point *all* disk I/O operations are halted. If a HEALTH_WARN state is observed, then one should take action to prevent the cluster from halting when it enters the HEALTH_ERROR state.

There is literally a ton of Ceph sub-commands to look at and manipulate Ceph objects. Well beyond the scope of a few troubleshooting techniques and there are other sites and documentation sets that deal more with assisting one with troubleshooting a Ceph environment. In addition, there are other helpful hints and some best practices concerning a Ceph environment located in the [Advanced Configuration section](advanced-configuration.md). Of particular note there are scripts for collecting logs and gathering OSD information there.


# Pod Using Rook Storage Is Not Running

## Symptoms
* The pod that is configured to use Rook storage is stuck in the `ContainerCreating` status
* `kubectl describe pod` for the pod mentions one or more of the following:
  * `PersistentVolumeClaim is not bound`
  * `timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach/mount`
* `kubectl -n rook-system get pod` shows the rook-agent pods in a `CrashLoopBackOff` status

## Possible Solutions Summary
* `rook-agent` pod is in a `CrashLoopBackOff` status because it cannot deploy its driver on a read-only filesystem: [Flexvolume configuration pre-reqs](./k8s-pre-reqs.md#flexvolume-configuration)
* Persistent Volume and/or Claim are failing to be created and bound: [Volume Creation](#volume-creation)
* `rook-agent` pod is failing to mount and format the volume: [Rook Agent Mounting](#volume-mounting)
* You are using Kubernetes 1.7.x or earlier and the Kubelet has not been restarted after `rook-agent` is in the `Running` status: [Restart Kubelet](#kubelet-restart)
* You are using Kubernetes 1.6.x and the attach-detach controller has not been disabled: [Disable attach-detach controller](./quickstart.md#disable-attacher-detacher-controller)

## Investigation Details
If you see some of the symptoms above, it's because the requested Rook storage for your pod is not being created and mounted successfully.
In this walkthrough, we will be looking at the wordpress mysql example pod that is failing to start.
To first confirm there is an issue, you can run commands similar to the following and you should see similar output (note that some of it has been omitted for brevity):
```console
> kubectl get pod
NAME                              READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
wordpress-mysql-918363043-50pjr   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          1h

> kubectl describe pod wordpress-mysql-918363043-50pjr
...

  1h		35s		36	kubelet, 172.17.8.101			Warning		FailedSync		Error syncing pod
```

To troubleshoot this, let's walk through the volume provisioning steps in order to confirm where the failure is happening.

### Rook Agent Deployment
The `rook-agent` pods are responsible for mapping and mounting the volume from the cluster onto the node that your pod will be running on.
If the `rook-agent` pod is not running then it cannot perform this function.
Below is an example of the `rook-agent` pods failing to get to the `Running` status because they are in a `CrashLoopBackOff` status:
```console
> kubectl -n rook-system get pod
NAME                             READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
rook-agent-ct5pj                 0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   16         59m
rook-agent-zb6n9                 0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   16         59m
rook-operator-2203999069-pmhzn   1/1       Running            0          59m
```
If you see this occurring, you can get more details about why the `rook-agent` pods are continuing to crash with the following command and its sample output:
```console
> kubectl -n rook-system get pod -l app=rook-agent -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.containerStatuses[0].lastState.terminated.message}{"\n"}{end}'
rook-agent-ct5pj	mkdir /usr/libexec/kubernetes: read-only file system
rook-agent-zb6n9	mkdir /usr/libexec/kubernetes: read-only file system
```
From the output above, we can see that the agents were not able to bind mount to `/usr/libexec/kubernetes` on the host they are scheduled to run on.
For some environments, this default path is read-only and therefore a better path must be provided to the agents.

First, clean up the agent deployment with:
```console
kubectl -n rook-system delete daemonset rook-agent
```
Once the `rook-agent` pods are gone, **follow the instructions in the [Flexvolume configuration pre-reqs](./k8s-pre-reqs.md#flexvolume-configuration)** to ensure a good value for `--volume-plugin-dir` has been provided to the Kubelet.
After that has been configured, and the Kubelet has been restarted, start the agent pods up again by restarting `rook-operator`:
```console
kubectl -n rook-system delete pod -l app=rook-operator
```

### Kubelet Restart
#### **Kubernetes 1.7.x and earlier only**
If the `rook-agent` pods are all in the `Running` state then another thing to confirm is that **if you are running on Kubernetes 1.7.x or earlier**, the Kubelet must be restarted after the `rook-agent` pods are running.

A symptom of this can be found in the Kubelet's log/journal, with the following error saying `no volume plugin matched`:
```console
Oct 30 22:23:03 core-02 kubelet-wrapper[31926]: E1030 22:23:03.524159   31926 desired_state_of_world_populator.go:285] Failed to add volume "mysql-persistent-storage" (specName: "pvc-9f273fbc") for pod "9f2ff89a-bdbf" to desiredStateOfWorld. err=failed to get Plugin from volumeSpec for volume "pvc-9f273fbc" err=no volume plugin matched
```
If you encounter this, just **restart the Kubelet process**, as described in the **[Restart Kubelet](./quickstart.md#restart-kubelet)** section of the Rook deployment guide.

### Volume Creation
The volume must first be created in the Ceph cluster and then bound to a volume claim before it can be mounted to a pod.
Let's confirm that with the following commands and their output:
```console
> kubectl get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS     CLAIM                    STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE
pvc-9f273fbc-bdbf-11e7-bc4c-001c428b9fc8   20Gi       RWO           Delete          Bound      default/mysql-pv-claim   rook-block               25m

> kubectl get pvc
NAME             STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
mysql-pv-claim   Bound     pvc-9f273fbc-bdbf-11e7-bc4c-001c428b9fc8   20Gi       RWO           rook-block     25m
```
Both your volume and its claim should be in the `Bound` status.
If one or neither of them is not in the `Bound` status, then look for details of the issue in the `rook-operator` logs:
```console
kubectl -n rook-system logs `kubectl -n rook-system -l app=rook-operator get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'`
```
If the volume is failing to be created, there should be details in the log output, especially those tagged with `op-provisioner`.

### Volume Mounting
The final step in preparing Rook storage for your pod is for the `rook-agent` pod to mount and format it.
If all the preceding sections have been successful or inconclusive, then take a look at the `rook-agent` pod logs for further clues.
You can determine which `rook-agent` is running on the same node that your pod is scheduled on by using the `-o wide` output, then you can get the logs for that `rook-agent` pod similar to the example below:
```console
> kubectl -n rook-system get pod -o wide
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP             NODE
rook-agent-h6scx                 1/1       Running   0          9m        172.17.8.102   172.17.8.102
rook-agent-mp7tn                 1/1       Running   0          9m        172.17.8.101   172.17.8.101
rook-operator-2203999069-3tb68   1/1       Running   0          9m        10.32.0.7      172.17.8.101

> kubectl -n rook-system logs rook-agent-h6scx
2017-10-30 23:07:06.984108 I | rook: starting Rook v0.5.0-241.g48ce6de.dirty with arguments '/usr/local/bin/rook agent'
...
```

In the `rook-agent` pod logs, you may see a snippet similar to the following:
```console
Failed to complete rbd: signal: interrupt.
```
In this case, the agent waited for the `rbd` command but it did not finish in a timely manner so the agent gave up and stopped it.
This can happen for multiple reasons, but using `dmesg` will likely give you insight into the root cause.
If `dmesg` shows something similar to below, then it means you have an old kernel that can't talk to the cluster:
```console
libceph: mon2 10.205.92.13:6790 feature set mismatch, my 4a042a42 < server's 2004a042a42, missing 20000000000
```
If `uname -a` shows that you have a kernel version older than `3.15`, you'll need to perform **one** of the following:
* Disable some Ceph features by starting the [rook toolbox](./toolbox.md) and running `ceph osd crush tunables bobtail`
* Upgrade your kernel to `3.15` or later.

### Filesystem Mounting

In the `rook-agent` pod logs, you may see a snippet similar to the following:
```console
2017-11-07 00:04:37.808870 I | rook-flexdriver: WARNING: The node kernel version is 4.4.0-87-generic, which do not support multiple ceph filesystems. The kernel version has to be at least 4.7. If you have multiple ceph filesystems, the result could be inconsistent
```

This will happen in kernels with versions older than 4.7, where the option `mds_namespace` is not supported. This option is used to specify a filesystem namespace.

In this case, if there is only one filesystem in the Ceph cluster, there should be no issues and the mount should succeed. If you have more than one filesystem, inconsistent results may arise and the filesystem mounted may not be the one you specified.

If the issue is still not resolved from the steps above, please come chat with us on the **#general** channel of our [Rook Slack](https://rook-slackin.herokuapp.com/).
We want to help you get your storage working and learn from those lessons to prevent users in the future from seeing the same issue.

# Cluster failing to service requests

## Symptoms
* Execution of the `ceph` command hangs
* Execution of the `rookctl` command hangs
* PersistentVolumes are not being created
* Large amount of slow requests are blocking
* Large amount of stuck requests are blocking
* One or more MONs are restarting periodically

## Investigation
Create a [rook-tools pod](./toolbox.md) to investigate the current state of CEPH. Here is an example of what one might see. In this case the `ceph status` command would just hang so a CTRL-C needed to be send. The `rookctl status` command is able to give a good amount of detail. In some cases the rook-api pod needs to be restarted for `rookctl` to be able to gather information. If the rook-api is restarted, then the rook-tools pod should be restarted also.

```console

Another indication is when one or more of the MON pods restart frequently. Note the 'mon107' that has only been up for 16 minutes in the following output.

```console
$ kubectl -n ceph get all -o wide --show-all
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP               NODE

```

## Solution
What is happening here is that the MON pods are restarting and one or more of the CEPH daemons are not getting configured with the proper cluster information. This is commonly the result of not specifying a value for `dataDirHostPath` in your Cluster CRD.

The `dataDirHostPath` setting specifies a path on the local host for the CEPH daemons to store configuration and data. Setting this to a path like `/var/lib/ceph`, reapplying your Cluster CRD and restarting all the CEPH daemons (MON, MGR, OSD, RGW) should solve this problem. After the CEPH daemons have been restarted, it is advisable to restart the rook-api and [rook-tool Pods](./toolbox.md).

# Only a single monitor pod starts

## Symptoms
* Rook operator is running
* Only one mon pod is running

## Investigation
When the operator is starting a cluster, the operator will start one mon at a time and check that they are healthy before continuing to bring up all three mons.
If the first mon is not detected healthy, the operator will continue to check until it is healthy. There are two likely causes for the mon health not being detected:
- The operator pod does not have network connectivity to the mon pod
- The mon pod is failing to start

### Operator fails to connect to the mon
First look at the logs of the operator to confirm if it is able to connect to the mons.
```
$ kubectl -n rook-system logs -l app=rook-operator
```

Likely you will see an error similar to the following that the operator is timing out when connecting to the mon. The last command is `ceph mon_status`,
followed by a timeout message five minutes later.
```
2018-01-21 21:47:32.375833 I | exec: Running command: ceph mon_status --cluster=rook --conf=/var/lib/rook/rook/rook.config --keyring=/var/lib/rook/rook/client.admin.keyring --format json --out-file /tmp/442263890
2018-01-21 21:52:35.370533 I | exec: 2018-01-21 21:52:35.071462 7f96a3b82700  0 monclient(hunting): authenticate timed out after 300

2018-01-21 21:52:35.071524 7f96a3b82700  0 librados: client.admin authentication error (110) Connection timed out
2018-01-21 21:52:35.071524 7f96a3b82700  0 librados: client.admin authentication error (110) Connection timed out
[errno 110] error connecting to the cluster
```

The error would appear to be an authentication error, but it is misleading. The real issue is a timeout.

### Solution
If you see the timeout in the operator log, verify if the mon pod is running (see the next section).
If the mon pod is running, check the network connectivity between the operator pod and the mon pod.
A common issue is that the CNI is not configured correctly.

### Failing mon pod
Second we need to verify if the mon pod started successfully.

```
$ kubectl -n ceph get pod -l app=rook-ceph-mon
NAME                   READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-mon0-r8tbl   0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   2          47s
```

If the mon pod is failing as in this example, you will need to look at the mon pod status or logs to determine the cause. If the pod is in a crash loop backoff state,
you should see the reason by describing the pod.

```
# the pod shows a termination status that the keyring does not match the existing keyring
$ kubectl -n ceph describe pod -l mon=rook-ceph-mon0
...
    Last State:		Terminated
      Reason:		Error
      Message:		The keyring does not match the existing keyring in /var/lib/ceph/rook-ceph-mon0/data/keyring.
                    You may need to delete the contents of dataDirHostPath on the host from a previous deployment.
...
```

### Solution
This is a common problem reinitializing the Ceph cluster when the local directory used for persistence has **not** been purged.
This directory is the `dataDirHostPath` setting in the cluster CRD and is typically set to `/var/lib/ceph`.
To fix the issue you will need to delete all components of Rook and then delete the contents of `/var/lib/ceph` (or the directory specified by `dataDirHostPath`) on each of the hosts in the cluster.
Then when the cluster CRD is applied to start a new cluster, the rook-operator should start all the pods as expected.


# OSD pods are failing to start

## Symptoms
* OSD pods are failing to start
* You have started a cluster after tearing down another cluster

## Investigation
When an OSD starts, the device or directory will be configured for consumption. If there is an error with the configuration, the pod will crash and you will see the CrashLoopBackoff
status for the pod. Look in the osd pod logs for an indication of the failure.
```
$ kubectl -n ceph logs rook-ceph-osd-fl8fs
...
```

One common case for failure is that you have re-deployed a test cluster and some state may remain from a previous deployment.
If your cluster is larger than a few nodes, you may get lucky enough that the monitors were able to start and form quorum. However, now the OSDs pods may fail to start due to the
old state. Looking at the OSD pod logs you will see an error about the file already existing.
```
$ kubectl -n ceph logs rook-ceph-osd-fl8fs
...

```

## Solution
If the error is from the file that already exists, this is a common problem reinitializing the Ceph cluster when the local directory used for persistence has **not** been purged.
This directory is the `dataDirHostPath` setting in the cluster CRD and is typically set to `/var/lib/ceph`.
To fix the issue you will need to delete all components of Rook and then delete the contents of `/var/lib/ceph` (or the directory specified by `dataDirHostPath`) on each of the hosts in the cluster.
Then when the cluster CRD is applied to start a new cluster, the rook-operator should start all the pods as expected.
