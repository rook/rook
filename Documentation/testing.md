## Test how some console line things get displayed on the website

We have lots of options for how to do this, and I think it makes sense to focus on what the rendered
output looks like.

### Option 1
```console
ceph config set 
```
```
output
of
the
command
```

### Option 2
```console
ceph config set
```
> ```
> output
> of
> the
> command
> ```

### Option 3
> ```console
> ceph config set
> ```
> ```
> output
> of
> the
> command
> ```

### Option 4
`ceph config set`
```
output
of
the
command
```

### Option 5
`ceph config set`
> ```
> output
> of
> the
> command
> ```

### Option 6
> `ceph config set`
> ```
> output
> of
> the
> command
> ```

### Option 7
```console 
$ ceph config set
output
of
the
command
```

### Option 8
```console
# ceph config set
output
of
the
command
```

### Option 9
```console 
> ceph config set
output

the
command
```
