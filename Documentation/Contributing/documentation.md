We are using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Markdown Extensions

Thanks to the MkDocs Material theme we have certain "markdown syntax extensions" available:

* [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/)
* [Footnotes](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/footnotes/)
* [Icons, Emojis](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/)
* [Task lists](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/lists/#using-definition-lists)
* And [more](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/)..

For a whole list of features [Reference - Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).

## Local Preview

To locally preview the documentation, you can run the following command (in the root of the repository):

```console
make docs-preview
```

When previewing, now you can navigate your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to open the preview of the documentation.

!!! hint
    Should you encounter a `command not found` error while trying to preview the docs for the first
    time on a machine, you probably need to install the dependencies for MkDocs and extensions used:
    `pip3 install -r build/release/requirements_docs.txt`. Make sure that your Python binary path is
    included in your `PATH`.

## Making docs

[helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) is a tool that generates the documentation for a helm chart automatically. If there are changes in the helm chart, the developer needs to run `make docs` (to run helm-docs) and check in the resulting autogenerated files.
To make it easy to check locally for uncommitted changes generated by `make docs`, an additional `make` target exists: simply running `make check-docs` will run the docs auto-generation and will complain if this produces uncommitted changes to doc files. It is therefore a good habit to always run `make check-docs` locally before creating or updating a PR.
