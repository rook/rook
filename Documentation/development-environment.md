# Multi-Node Test Environment

## Setup expectation

There are a bunch of pre-requisites to be able to deploy the following environment. Such as:

* A Linux workstation (CentOS or Fedora)
* KVM/QEMU installation
* docker service allowing insecure local repository

For other Linux distribution, there is no guarantee the following will work.
However adapting commands (apt/yum/dnf) could just work.

## Prerequisites installation

On your host machine, execute `tests/scripts/multi-node/rpm-system-prerequisites.sh` (or
do the equivalent for your distribution)

Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to add insecure-registries:

```
{
        "insecure-registries":  ["172.17.8.1:5000"]
}
```


## Deploy Kubernetes with Kubespray

Clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray
cd kubespray
```

In order to successfully deploy Kubernetes with Kubespray, you must have this code: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray/pull/2153 and https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray/pull/2271.

Edit `inventory/group_vars/k8s-cluster.yml` with:

```bash
docker_options: {% raw %}"--insecure-registry=172.17.8.1:5000 --insecure-registry={{ kube_service_addresses }} --graph={{ docker_daemon_graph }}  {{ docker_log_opts }}"{% endraw %}
```

FYI: `172.17.8.1` is the libvirt bridge IP, so it's reachable from all your virtual machines.
This means a registry running on the host machine is reachable from the virtual machines running the Kubernetes cluster.

Create Vagrant's variable directory:

```bash
mkdir vagrant/
```

Put `tests/scripts/multi-node/config.rb` in `vagrant/`. You can adapt it at will.
Feel free to adapt `num_instances`.

Deploy!

```bash
vagrant up --no-provision ; vagrant provision
```

Go grab a coffee:

## Running the Kubernetes Dashboard UI

kubespray sets up the Dashboard pod by default, but you must authenticate with a bearer token, even for localhost access with kubectl proxy.  To allow access, one possible solution is to:

1) Create an admin user by creating admin-user.yaml with these contents (and using kubectl -f create admin-user.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: admin-user
  namespace: kube-system
```

2) Grant that user the ClusterRole authorization by creating and applying admin-user-cluster.role.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: admin-user
  namespace: kube-system
```

3) Find the admin-user token in the kube-system namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep admin-user | awk '{print $1}')
```

and you can use that token to log into the UI at http://localhost:8001/ui.

(See [https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Creating-sample-user](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Creating-sample-user))



## Development workflow on the host

Everything should happen on the host, your development environment will reside on the host machine NOT inside the virtual machines running the Kubernetes cluster.

Now, please refer to [https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/development-flow.html](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/development-flow.html) to setup your development environment (go, git etc).

At this stage, Rook should be cloned on your host.

From your Rook repository (should be $GOPATH/src/github.com/rook) location execute `bash tests/scripts/multi-node/build-rook.sh`.
During its execution, `build-rook.sh` will purge all running Rook pods from the cluster, so that your latest container image can be deployed.
Furthermore, **all Ceph data and config will be purged** as well.
Ensure that you are done with all existing state on your test cluster before executing `build-rook.sh` as it will clear everything.

Each time you build and deploy with `build-rook.sh`, the virtual machines (k8s-0X) will pull the new container image and run your new Rook code.
You can run `bash tests/scripts/multi-node/build-rook.sh` as many times as you want to rebuild your new rook image and redeploy a cluster that is running your new code.

From here, resume your dev, change your code and test it by running `bash tests/scripts/multi-node/build-rook.sh`.


## Teardown

Typically, to flush your environment you will run the following from within kubespray's git repository.
This action will be performed on the host:

```bash
[user@host-machine kubespray]$ vagrant destroy -f
```

Also, if you were using `kubectl` on that host machine, you can resurrect your old configuration by renaming `$HOME/.kube/config.before.rook.$TIMESTAMP` with `$HOME/.kube/config`.

If you were not using `kubectl`, feel free to simply remove `$HOME/.kube/config.rook`.
