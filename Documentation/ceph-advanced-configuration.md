## Prerequisites

Most of the examples make use of the `ceph` client command.  A quick way to use
the Ceph client suite is from a [Rook Toolbox container](ceph-toolbox.md).

The Kubernetes based examples assume Rook OSD pods are in the `rook-ceph` namespace.
If you run them in a different namespace, modify `kubectl -n rook-ceph [...]` to fit
your situation.

## Use custom Ceph user and secret for mounting

> **NOTE**: For extensive info about creating Ceph users, consult the Ceph documentation: http://docs.ceph.com/docs/mimic/rados/operations/user-management/#add-a-user.

Using a custom Ceph user and secret can be done for filesystem and block storage.

Create a custom user in Ceph with read-write access in the `/bar` directory on CephFS (For Ceph Mimic or newer, use `data=POOL_NAME` instead of `pool=POOL_NAME`):

```console
ceph auth get-or-create-key client.user1 mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw tag cephfs pool=YOUR_FS_DATA_POOL' mds 'allow r, allow rw path=/bar'
```

The command will return a Ceph secret key, this key should be added as a secret in Kubernetes like this:

```console
kubectl create secret generic ceph-user1-secret --from-literal=key=YOUR_CEPH_KEY
```

> **NOTE**: This secret with the same name must be created in each namespace where the StorageClass will be used.

In addition to this Secret you must create a RoleBinding to allow the Rook Ceph agent to get the secret from each namespace.
The RoleBinding is optional if you are using a ClusterRoleBinding for the Rook Ceph agent secret access.
A ClusterRole which contains the permissions which are needed and used for the Bindings are shown as an example after the next step.

On a StorageClass `parameters` and/or flexvolume Volume entry `options` set the following options:

```yaml
mountUser: user1
mountSecret: ceph-user1-secret
```

If you want the Rook Ceph agent to require a `mountUser` and `mountSecret` to be set in StorageClasses using Rook, you must set the environment variable `AGENT_MOUNT_SECURITY_MODE` to `Restricted` on the Rook Ceph operator Deployment.

For more information on using the Ceph feature to limit access to CephFS paths, see [Ceph Documentation - Path Restriction](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/mimic/cephfs/client-auth/#path-restriction).

### ClusterRole

> **NOTE**: When you are using the Helm chart to install the Rook Ceph operator and have set `mountSecurityMode` to e.g., `Restricted`, then the below ClusterRole has already been created for you.

**This ClusterRole is needed no matter if you want to use a RoleBinding per namespace or a ClusterRoleBinding.**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-agent-mount
  labels:
    operator: rook
    storage-backend: ceph
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - secrets
  verbs:
  - get
```

### RoleBinding

> **NOTE**: You either need a RoleBinding in each namespace in which a mount secret resides in or create a ClusterRoleBinding with which the Rook Ceph agent
> has access to Kubernetes secrets in all namespaces.

Create the RoleBinding shown here in each namespace the Rook Ceph agent should read secrets for mounting.
The RoleBinding `subjects`' `namespace` must be the one the Rook Ceph agent runs in (default `rook-ceph` for version 1.0 and newer. The default namespace in
previous versions was `rook-ceph-system`).

Replace `namespace: name-of-namespace-with-mountsecret` according to the name of all namespaces a `mountSecret` can be in.

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-agent-mount
  namespace: name-of-namespace-with-mountsecret
  labels:
    operator: rook
    storage-backend: ceph
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: rook-ceph-agent-mount
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: rook-ceph-system
  namespace: rook-ceph
```

### ClusterRoleBinding

This ClusterRoleBinding only needs to be created once, as it covers the whole cluster.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-agent-mount
  labels:
    operator: rook
    storage-backend: ceph
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: rook-ceph-agent-mount
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: rook-ceph-system
  namespace: rook-ceph
```

## Log Collection

All Rook logs can be collected in a Kubernetes environment with the following command:

```console
for p in $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
    for c in $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod ${p} -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}')
    do
        echo "BEGIN logs from pod: ${p} ${c}"
        kubectl -n rook-ceph logs -c ${c} ${p}
        echo "END logs from pod: ${p} ${c}"
    done
done
```

This gets the logs for every container in every Rook pod and then compresses them into a `.gz` archive
for easy sharing.  Note that instead of `gzip`, you could instead pipe to `less` or to a single text file.

## OSD Information

Keeping track of OSDs and their underlying storage devices can be
difficult. The following scripts will clear things up quickly.

### Kubernetes

```console
# Get OSD Pods
# This uses the example/default cluster name "rook"
OSD_PODS=$(kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l \
  app=rook-ceph-osd,rook_cluster=rook-ceph -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')

# Find node and drive associations from OSD pods
for pod in $(echo ${OSD_PODS})
do
 echo "Pod:  ${pod}"
 echo "Node: $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod ${pod} -o jsonpath='{.spec.nodeName}')"
 kubectl -n rook-ceph exec ${pod} -- sh -c '\
  for i in /var/lib/rook/osd*; do
    [ -f ${i}/ready ] || continue
    echo -ne "-$(basename ${i}) "
    echo $(lsblk -n -o NAME,SIZE ${i}/block 2> /dev/null || \
    findmnt -n -v -o SOURCE,SIZE -T ${i}) $(cat ${i}/type)
  done | sort -V
  echo'
done
```

The output should look something like this. Note that OSDs on the same node will show duplicate information.

```console
Pod:  osd-m2fz2
Node: node1.zbrbdl
-osd0  sda3  557.3G  bluestore
-osd1  sdf3  110.2G  bluestore
-osd2  sdd3  277.8G  bluestore
-osd3  sdb3  557.3G  bluestore
-osd4  sde3  464.2G  bluestore
-osd5  sdc3  557.3G  bluestore

Pod:  osd-nxxnq
Node: node3.zbrbdl
-osd6   sda3  110.7G  bluestore
-osd17  sdd3  1.8T    bluestore
-osd18  sdb3  231.8G  bluestore
-osd19  sdc3  231.8G  bluestore

Pod:  osd-tww1h
Node: node2.zbrbdl
-osd7   sdc3  464.2G  bluestore
-osd8   sdj3  557.3G  bluestore
-osd9   sdf3  66.7G   bluestore
-osd10  sdd3  464.2G  bluestore
-osd11  sdb3  147.4G  bluestore
-osd12  sdi3  557.3G  bluestore
-osd13  sdk3  557.3G  bluestore
-osd14  sde3  66.7G   bluestore
-osd15  sda3  110.2G  bluestore
-osd16  sdh3  135.1G  bluestore
```

## Separate Storage Groups

> **DEPRECATED**: Instead of manually needing to set this, the `deviceClass` property can be used on Pool structures in `CephBlockPool`, `CephFilesystem` and `CephObjectStore` CRD objects.

By default Rook/Ceph puts all storage under one replication rule in the CRUSH
Map which provides the maximum amount of storage capacity for a cluster.  If you
would like to use different storage endpoints for different purposes, you'll
have to create separate storage groups.

In the following example we will separate SSD drives from spindle-based drives,
a common practice for those looking to target certain workloads onto faster
(database) or slower (file archive) storage.

## Configuring Pools

### Placement Group Sizing

> **NOTE**: Since Ceph Nautilus (v14.x), you can use the Ceph MGR `pg_autoscaler`
> module to auto scale the PGs as needed. If you want to enable this feature,
> please refer to [Default PG and PGP counts](ceph-configuration.md#default-pg-and-pgp-counts).

The general rules for deciding how many PGs your pool(s) should contain is:

* Less than 5 OSDs set pg_num to 128
* Between 5 and 10 OSDs set pg_num to 512
* Between 10 and 50 OSDs set pg_num to 1024

If you have more than 50 OSDs, you need to understand the tradeoffs and how to
calculate the pg_num value by yourself. For calculating pg_num yourself please
make use of [the pgcalc tool](http://ceph.com/pgcalc/).

If you're already using a pool it is generally safe to [increase its PG
count](#setting-pg-count) on-the-fly. Decreasing the PG count is not
recommended on a pool that is in use. The safest way to decrease the PG count
is to back-up the data, [delete the pool](#deleting-a-pool), and [recreate
it](#creating-a-pool).  With backups you can try a few potentially unsafe
tricks for live pools, documented
[here](http://cephnotes.ksperis.com/blog/2015/04/15/ceph-pool-migration).

### Setting PG Count

Be sure to read the [placement group sizing](#placement-group-sizing) section
before changing the number of PGs.

```console
# Set the number of PGs in the rbd pool to 512
ceph osd pool set rbd pg_num 512
```

## Custom ceph.conf Settings

> **WARNING**: The advised method for controlling Ceph configuration is to manually use the Ceph CLI
> or the Ceph dashboard because this offers the most flexibility. It is highly recommended that this
> only be used when absolutely necessary and that the `config` be reset to an empty string if/when the
> configurations are no longer necessary. Configurations in the config file will make the Ceph cluster
> less configurable from the CLI and dashboard and may make future tuning or debugging difficult.

Setting configs via Ceph's CLI requires that at least one mon be available for the configs to be
set, and setting configs via dashboard requires at least one mgr to be available. Ceph may also have
a small number of very advanced settings that aren't able to be modified easily via CLI or
dashboard. In order to set configurations before monitors are available or to set problematic
configuration settings, the `rook-config-override` ConfigMap exists, and the `config` field can be
set with the contents of a `ceph.conf` file. The contents will be propagated to all mon, mgr, OSD,
MDS, and RGW daemons as an `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf` file.

> **WARNING**: Rook performs no validation on the config, so the  validity of the settings is the
> user's responsibility.

If the `rook-config-override` ConfigMap is created before the cluster is started, the Ceph daemons
will automatically pick up the settings. If you add the settings to the ConfigMap after the cluster
has been initialized, each daemon will need to be restarted where you want the settings applied:

* mons: ensure all three mons are online and healthy before restarting each mon pod, one at a time.
* mgrs: the pods are stateless and can be restarted as needed, but note that this will disrupt the
  Ceph dashboard during restart.
* OSDs: restart your the pods by deleting them, one at a time, and running `ceph -s`
between each restart to ensure the cluster goes back to "active/clean" state.
* RGW: the pods are stateless and can be restarted as needed.
* MDS: the pods are stateless and can be restarted as needed.

After the pod restart, the new settings should be in effect. Note that if the ConfigMap in the Ceph
cluster's namespace is created before the cluster is created, the daemons will pick up the settings
at first launch.

### Example

In this example we will set the default pool `size` to two, and tell OSD
daemons not to change the weight of OSDs on startup.

> **WARNING**: Modify Ceph settings carefully. You are leaving the sandbox tested by Rook.
> Changing the settings could result in unhealthy daemons or even data loss if used incorrectly.

When the Rook Operator creates a cluster, a placeholder ConfigMap is created that
will allow you to override Ceph configuration settings. When the daemon pods are started, the
settings specified in this ConfigMap will be merged with the default settings
generated by Rook.

The default override settings are blank. Cutting out the extraneous properties,
we would see the following defaults after creating a cluster:

```console
$ kubectl -n rook-ceph get ConfigMap rook-config-override -o yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: rook-config-override
  namespace: rook-ceph
data:
  config: ""
```

To apply your desired configuration, you will need to update this ConfigMap. The next time the
daemon pod(s) start, they will use the updated configs.

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph edit configmap rook-config-override
```

Modify the settings and save. Each line you add should be indented from the `config` property as such:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rook-config-override
  namespace: rook-ceph
data:
  config: |
    [global]
    osd crush update on start = false
    osd pool default size = 2
```

## OSD CRUSH Settings

A useful view of the [CRUSH Map](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/crush-map/)
is generated with the following command:

```console
ceph osd tree
```

In this section we will be tweaking some of the values seen in the output.

### OSD Weight

The CRUSH weight controls the ratio of data that should be distributed to each
OSD.  This also means a higher or lower amount of disk I/O operations for an OSD
with higher/lower weight, respectively.

By default OSDs get a weight relative to their storage capacity, which maximizes
overall cluster capacity by filling all drives at the same rate, even if drive
sizes vary.  This should work for most use-cases, but the following situations
could warrant weight changes:

* Your cluster has some relatively slow OSDs or nodes. Lowering their weight can
  reduce the impact of this bottleneck.
* You're using bluestore drives provisioned with Rook v0.3.1 or older.  In this
  case you may notice OSD weights did not get set relative to their storage
  capacity.  Changing the weight can fix this and maximize cluster capacity.

This example sets the weight of osd.0 which is 600GiB

```console
ceph osd crush reweight osd.0 .600
```

### OSD Primary Affinity

When pools are set with a size setting greater than one, data is replicated
between nodes and OSDs.  For every chunk of data a Primary OSD is selected to be
used for reading that data to be sent to clients.  You can control how likely it
is for an OSD to become a Primary using the Primary Affinity setting.  This is
similar to the OSD weight setting, except it only affects reads on the storage
device, not capacity or writes.

In this example we will make sure `osd.0` is only selected as Primary if all
other OSDs holding replica data are unavailable:

```console
ceph osd primary-affinity osd.0 0
```

## OSD Dedicated Network

It is possible to configure ceph to leverage a dedicated network for the OSDs to
communicate across. A useful overview is the [CEPH Networks](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/configuration/network-config-ref/#ceph-networks)
section of the Ceph documentation. If you declare a cluster network, OSDs will
route heartbeat, object replication and recovery traffic over the cluster
network. This may improve performance compared to using a single network.

Two changes are necessary to the configuration to enable this capability:

### Use hostNetwork in the rook ceph cluster configuration

Enable the `hostNetwork` setting in the [Ceph Cluster CRD configuration](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/ceph-cluster-crd.html#samples).
For example,

```yaml
  network:
    hostNetwork: true
```

> IMPORTANT: Changing this setting is not supported in a running Rook cluster. Host networking
> should be configured when the cluster is first created.

### Define the subnets to use for public and private OSD networks

Edit the `rook-config-override` configmap to define the custom network
configuration:

```console
kubectl -n rook-ceph edit configmap rook-config-override
```

In the editor, add a custom configuration to instruct ceph which subnet is the
public network and which subnet is the private network. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config: |
    [global]
    public network =  10.0.7.0/24
    cluster network = 10.0.10.0/24
    public addr = ""
    cluster addr = ""
```

After applying the updated rook-config-override configmap, it will be necessary
to restart the OSDs by deleting the OSD pods in order to apply the change.
Restart the OSD pods by deleting them, one at a time, and running ceph -s
between each restart to ensure the cluster goes back to "active/clean" state.

## Phantom OSD Removal

If you have OSDs in which are not showing any disks, you can remove those "Phantom OSDs" by following the instructions below.
To check for "Phantom OSDs", you can run:

```console
ceph osd tree
```

An example output looks like this:

```console
ID  CLASS WEIGHT  TYPE NAME STATUS REWEIGHT PRI-AFF
 -1       57.38062 root default
-13        7.17258     host node1.example.com
  2   hdd  3.61859         osd.2                up  1.00000 1.00000
 -7              0     host node2.example.com   down    0    1.00000
```

The host `node2.example.com` in the output has no disks, so it is most likely a "Phantom OSD".

Now to remove it, use the ID in the first column of the output and replace `<ID>` with it. In the example output above the ID would be `-7`.
The commands are:

```console
ceph osd out <ID>
ceph osd crush remove osd.<ID>
ceph auth del osd.<ID>
ceph osd rm <ID>
```

To recheck that the Phantom OSD was removed, re-run the following command and check if the OSD with the ID doesn't show up anymore:

```console
ceph osd tree
```

## Change Failure Domain

In Rook, it is now possible to indicate how the default CRUSH failure domain rule must be configured in order to ensure that replicas or erasure code shards are separated across hosts, and a single host failure does not affect availability. For instance, this is an example manifest of a block pool named `replicapool` configured with a `failureDomain` set to `osd`:

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephBlockPool
metadata:
  name: replicapool
  namespace: rook
spec:
  # The failure domain will spread the replicas of the data across different failure zones
  failureDomain: osd
  ...
```

However, due to several reasons, we may need to change such failure domain to its other value: `host`. Unfortunately, changing it directly in the YAML manifest is not currently handled by Rook, so we need to perform the change directly using Ceph commands using the Rook tools pod, for instance:

```console
$ ceph osd pool get replicapool crush_rule
crush_rule: replicapool

$ceph osd crush rule create-replicated replicapool_host_rule default host
```

Notice that the suffix `host_rule` in the name of the rule is just for clearness about the type of rule we are creating here, and can be anything else as long as it is different from the existing one. Once the new rule has been created, we simply apply it to our block pool:

```console
ceph osd pool set replicapool crush_rule replicapool_host_rule
```

And validate that it has been actually applied properly:

```console
$ ceph osd pool get replicapool crush_rule
crush_rule: replicapool_host_rule
```

If the cluster's health was `HEALTH_OK` when we performed this change, immediately, the new rule is applied to the cluster transparently without service disruption.

Exactly the same approach can be used to change from `host` back to `osd`.
