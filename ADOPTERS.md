  University of California and the state of California with the goal of *"inventing the university

  users.
* [NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration)](https://www.nav.no/) is the current Norwegian

  open-source [kURL](https://kurl.sh/): a custom Kubernetes distro creator that software vendors use
  to package and distribute production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure. Rook is a default add-on in
  kURL, so all installations include Rook to manage highly available storage that the software
  vendor can depend on.
* [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) is building the largest and most comprehensive music database
  and marketplace in the world and services millions of users all across the globe. Rook enables

  that lets them take advantage of a mature storage product with ease and peace of mind.
