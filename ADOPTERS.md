# Rook Adopters

Below is a list of adopters of Rook in **production environments** that have publicly shared the
details of their usage as well as the benefits provided by Rook that their business relies on. There
are additional adopters of Rook, especially those with on-premises deployments, that are not ready
to share the details of their usage publicly at this time.

* [Calit2 (California Institute for Telecommunications and Information
  Technology)](http://www.calit2.net/) is one of 4 institutes formed by a joint partnership of
  University of California and the state of California with the goal of *"inventing the university
  research environment of the future"*.  They operate one of the largest known Rook clusters in
  production and they are using Rook to provide cheap, reliable, and fast storage to scientific
  users.
* [NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration)](https://www.nav.no/) is the current Norwegian
  public welfare agency, responsible for 1/3 of the state budget of Norway. They find a massive
  simplification of management and maintenance for their Ceph clusters by adopting Rook.

  open-source [kURL](https://kurl.sh/): a custom Kubernetes distro creator that software vendors use

  kURL, so all installations include Rook to manage highly available storage that the software
  vendor can depend on.
* [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) is building the largest and most comprehensive music database

  The Rook Ceph operator is key to the Kubernetes clusters frequently set up for projects by
  small-medium enterprises in the CENGN labs.
* [Avisi](https://www.avisi.nl/) develops and operates software for organizations like the the Dutch
  Notary Association. They have survived multiple disaster scenarios already with Rook and it has
  made their cloud native journey in the private cloud so much easier by providing a powerful tool
  that lets them take advantage of a mature storage product with ease and peace of mind.
