# The deployment for the rook operator
# Contains the common settings for most Kubernetes deployments.
# For example, to create the rook-ceph cluster:
#   kubectl create -f common.yaml
#   kubectl create -f operator.yaml
#   kubectl create -f cluster.yaml

# Also see other operator sample files for variations of operator.yaml:
