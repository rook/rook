# The deployment for the rook operator
# Contains the common settings for most Kubernetes deployments.
# For example, to create the rook-ceph cluster:
#   kubectl create -f common.yaml
#   kubectl create -f operator.yaml
#   kubectl create -f cluster.yaml
#
# Also see other operator sample files for variations of operator.yaml:
# - operator-openshift.yaml: Common settings for running in OpenShift
# - operator-with-csi.yaml: Enable the ceph-csi driver
