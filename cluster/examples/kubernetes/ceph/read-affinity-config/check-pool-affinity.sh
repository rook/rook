# Note to reader:
# This script should have been written in Python. In order to make it more portable and not to mess
# with various dependencies and installation, I decided to develop it in bash, with only one 
# dependency, (jq version 1.6). It makes the sctipt more complex, and a bit more difficult to 
# develop and possibly maintain, but it should prevent many of the typical version/dependencies 
# issues with Python and since this script is meant to be used very rarely, it was worth this 
# extra development effort.
