# Define the settings for the rook-ceph cluster with common settings for a production cluster.
# All nodes with available raw devices will be used for the Ceph cluster. At least three nodes are required
# in this example. See the documentation for more details on storage settings available.

# For example, to create the cluster:
#   kubectl create -f common.yaml
#   kubectl create -f operator.yaml
#   kubectl create -f cluster.yaml
