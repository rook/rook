# Define the settings for the rook-ceph cluster with common settings for a production cluster.
# All nodes with available raw devices will be used for the Ceph cluster. At least three nodes are required
# in this example. See the documentation for more details on storage settings available.

# For example, to create the cluster:
#   kubectl create -f common.yaml
#   kubectl create -f operator.yaml
#   kubectl create -f cluster.yaml

    # versions running within the cluster. See tags available at https://hub.docker.com/r/ceph/ceph/tags/.
    # If you want to be more precise, you can always use a timestamp tag such ceph/ceph:v14.2.5-20190917
