parameters:
  # If you want to use erasure coded pool with RBD, you need to create two pools (as seen above): one erasure coded and one replicated.
  # You need to specify the replicated pool here in the `blockPool` parameter, it is used for the metadata of the images.
  # The erasure coded pool must be set as the `dataBlockPool` parameter below.
  blockPool: replicated-metadata-pool
  dataBlockPool: ec-data-pool
  # Specify the namespace of the rook cluster from which to create volumes.
  # If not specified, it will use `rook` as the default namespace of the cluster.
  # This is also the namespace where the cluster will be
  clusterNamespace: rook-ceph
  # Specify the filesystem type of the volume. If not specified, it will use `ext4`.
