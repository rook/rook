The Rook Operator has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l "app=rook-ceph-operator"

Visit https://rook.io/docs/rook/master for instructions on how to create and configure Rook clusters

Note: You cannot just create a CephCluster resource, you need to also create a namespace and
provide your own RBAC Roles and RoleBinding resources for the cluster. A sample cluster manifest is below.

{{ .Files.Get "sample-cephcluster.yaml" }}
