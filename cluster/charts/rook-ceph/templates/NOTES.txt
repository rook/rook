The Rook Operator has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l "app=rook-ceph-operator"

Visit https://rook.io/docs/rook/master for instructions on how to create and configure Rook clusters

Note: You cannot just create a CephCluster resource, you need to also create a namespace and
provide your own RBAC Roles and RoleBinding resources for the cluster. The Rook Operator
will not do this for you. Sample CephCluster manifest templates are available:

- https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/v0.9/ceph-quickstart.html
- https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/release-0.9/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/cluster.yaml

Important Notes:
- The links above are for release 0.9, if you deploy a different release you must find matching manifests.
- You must customise the 'CephCluster' resource at the bottom of the sample manifests to met your situation.
- Each CephCluster must be deployed to its own namespace.
- The sample manifests assume you installed the rook-ceph operator in the `rook-ceph-system` namespace.
- The RBAC in the sample manifests are required, the helm chart does not include everything required.
