# PSP for rook-ceph-operator

# Most of the teams follow the kubernetes docs and have these PSPs.
# * privileged (for kube-system namespace)
# * restricted (for all logged in users)
#
# If we name it as `rook-ceph-operator`, it comes next to `restricted` PSP alphabetically,
# and applies `restricted` capabilities to `rook-system`. Thats reason this is named with `00-rook-ceph-operator`,
# so it stays somewhere close to top and `rook-system` gets the intended PSP.
#
