# Create the common resources that are necessary to start the operator and the ceph cluster.
# These resources *must* be created before the operator.yaml and cluster.yaml or their variants.
# The samples all assume that a single operator will manage a single cluster crd in the same "rook-ceph" namespace.
#
# If the operator needs to manage multiple clusters (in different namespaces), see the section below
# for "cluster-specific resources". The resources below that section will need to be created for each namespace
# where the operator needs to manage the cluster. The resources above that section do not be created again.
#
# Most of the sections are prefixed with a 'OLM' keyword which is used to build our CSV for an OLM (Operator Life Cycle manager)
