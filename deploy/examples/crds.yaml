                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                          provisioner.
                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.

                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef

                        Rook will make a best-effort attempt to automatically detect CIDR address ranges for given
                        network attachment definitions. Rook's methods are robust but may be imprecise for
                        sufficiently complicated networks. Rook's auto-detection process obtains a new IP address
                        lease for each CephCluster reconcile. If Rook fails to detect, incorrectly detects, only
                        partially detects, or if underlying networks do not support reusing old IP addresses, it is
                        best to use the 'addressRanges' config section to specify CIDR ranges for the Ceph cluster.

                        Preventing the OSD pods to restart immediately in such scenarios will prevent Rook from marking OSD as `up` and thus
                        peering of the PGs mapped to the OSD.
                        User needs to manually restart the OSD pod if they manage to fix the underlying OSD flapping issue before the restart interval.
                        The sleep will be disabled if this interval is set to 0.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.
                                        If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
                                        in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
                                        it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                        will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                        If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                        will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                        If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                        set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                        exists.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            ConfigFiles defines where the Kerberos configuration should be sourced from. Config files
                            will be placed into the `/etc/krb5.conf.rook/` directory.

                            If this is left empty, Rook will not add any files. This allows you to manage the files
                            yourself however you wish. For example, you may build them into your custom Ceph container
                            image or use the Vault agent injector to securely add the files via annotations on the
                            CephNFS spec (passed to the NFS server pods).

                            Rook configures Kerberos to log to stderr. We suggest removing logging sections from config
                            files to avoid consuming unnecessary disk space from logging to files.

                            KeytabFile defines where the Kerberos keytab should be sourced from. The keytab file will be
                            placed into `/etc/krb5.keytab`. If this is left empty, Rook will not add the file.
                            This allows you to manage the `krb5.keytab` file yourself however you wish. For example, you
                            may build it into your custom Ceph container image or use the Vault agent injector to
                            securely add the file via annotations on the CephNFS spec (passed to the NFS server pods).

                            PrincipalName corresponds directly to NFS-Ganesha's NFS_KRB5:PrincipalName config. In
                            practice, this is the service prefix of the principal name. The default is "nfs".
                            This value is combined with (a) the namespace and name of the CephNFS (with a hyphen between)
                            and (b) the Realm configured in the user-provided krb5.conf to determine the full principal
                            name: <principalName>/<namespace>-<name>@<realm>. e.g., nfs/rook-ceph-my-nfs@example.net.

                                securely add the file via annotations on the CephNFS spec (passed to the NFS server pods).
