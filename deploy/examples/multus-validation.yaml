# This manifest contains a Kubernetes Job and supporting definitions for running Rook's Multus
# validation tool. The Multus validation tool's help text is copied below. Modify the Job
# definition in this manifest based on the needs of your cluster.

#
# Run a validation test that determines whether the current Multus and system
# configurations will support Rook with Multus.
#
# This should be run BEFORE Rook is installed.
#
# This is a fairly long-running test. It starts up a web server and many
# clients to verify that Multus network communication works properly.
#
# It does *not* perform any load testing. Networks that cannot support high
# volumes of Ceph traffic may still encounter runtime issues. This may be
# particularly noticeable with high I/O load or during OSD rebalancing
# (see: https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/architecture/#rebalancing).
# For example, during Rook or Ceph cluster upgrade.
#
# Override the kube config file location by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable.
#
# Usage:
#   rook multus validation run [--public-network=<nad-name>] [--cluster-network=<nad-name>] [flags]
#
# Flags:
#       --cluster-network string           The name of the Network Attachment Definition (NAD) that will be used for Ceph's cluster network. This should be a namespaced name in the form <namespace>/<name> if the NAD is defined in a different namespace from the cluster namespace.
#   -c, --config string                    The validation test config file to use. This cannot be used with other flags.
#       --daemons-per-node int             The number of validation test daemons to run per node. It is recommended to set this to the maximum number of Ceph daemons that can run on any node in the worst case of node failure(s). The default value is set to the worst-case value for a Rook Ceph cluster with 3 portable OSDs, 3 portable monitors, and where all optional child resources have been created with 1 daemon such that they all might run on a single node in a failure scenario. If you aren't sure what to choose for this value, add 1 for each additional OSD beyond 3. (default 19)
#   -h, --help                             help for run
#   -n, --namespace string                 The namespace for validation test resources. It is recommended to set this to the namespace in which Rook's Ceph cluster will be installed. (default "rook-ceph")
#       --nginx-image string               The Nginx image used for the validation server and clients. (default "nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:stable-alpine")
#       --public-network string            The name of the Network Attachment Definition (NAD) that will be used for Ceph's public network. This should be a namespaced name in the form <namespace>/<name> if the NAD is defined in a different namespace from the cluster namespace.
#       --timeout-minutes timeoutMinutes   The time to wait for resources to change to the expected state. For example, for the test web server to start, for test clients to become ready, or for test resources to be deleted. At longest, this may need to reflect the time it takes for client pods to to pull images, get address assignments, and then for each client to determine that its network connection is stable. Minimum: 1 minute. Recommended: 2 minutes or more. (default 3m0s)
#
# Global Flags:
#       --log-level string   logging level for logging/tracing output (valid values: ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG) (default "INFO")
