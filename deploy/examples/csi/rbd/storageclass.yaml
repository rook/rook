  # If you want to use erasure coded pool with RBD, you need to create
  # two pools. one erasure coded and one replicated.
  # You need to specify the replicated pool here in the `pool` parameter, it is
  # used for the metadata of the images.
  # The erasure coded pool must be set as the `dataPool` parameter below.

   # (optional) Set it to true to encrypt each volume with encryption keys

   # (optional) Use external key management system (KMS) for encryption key by

   # correlation to configmap entry.

  # RBD image format. Defaults to "2".
  imageFormat: "2"

  # RBD image features
  # Available for imageFormat: "2". Older releases of CSI RBD
  # support only the `layering` feature. The Linux kernel (KRBD) supports the
  # full complement of features as of 5.4
  # `layering` alone corresponds to Ceph's bitfield value of "2" ;
  # `layering` + `fast-diff` + `object-map` + `deep-flatten` + `exclusive-lock` together
  # correspond to Ceph's OR'd bitfield value of "63". Here we use
  # a symbolic, comma-separated format:
  # For 5.4 or later kernels:
  #imageFeatures: layering,fast-diff,object-map,deep-flatten,exclusive-lock
  # For 5.3 or earlier kernels:
  imageFeatures: layering

  # The secrets contain Ceph admin credentials. These are generated automatically by the operator
  # in the same namespace as the cluster.
