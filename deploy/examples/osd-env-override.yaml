  # Bypass the ASan's assertion that it is the very first loaded DSO.
  # This is necessary for crimson-osd as it's currently built with
  # the ASan sanitizer turned on which means the `libasan.so` must
  # the be the very first loaded dynamic library. Unfortunately, this
  # isn't fulfilled as the containers use `ld.preload`, so ASan was
  # aborting the entire OSD.
