                    See more details [here](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/skip-attach.html#skip-attach-with-csi-driver-object).
                    If set to false it skips the volume attachments and makes the creation of pods using the CephCsi PVC fast.
                    **WARNING** It's highly discouraged to use this for RWO volumes. for RBD PVC it can cause data corruption,
                    csi-addons operations like Reclaimspace and PVC Keyrotation will also not be supported if set to false
                    since we'll have no VolumeAttachments to determine which node the PVC is mounted on.
                    Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/103305) for more details.

                                description: |-
                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.


                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.


                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.
                                properties:
                                  volumeClaimTemplate:

                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                              provisioner.
                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified.
                                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                in any namespaces.
                                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                                Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                Default value is 0.
                                Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                cause evictions during disruption.

                                can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                the update.

                                description: |-
                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.


                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.


                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.
                                properties:
                                  volumeClaimTemplate:

                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                              provisioner.
                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified.
                                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                in any namespaces.
                                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        If set to false it skips the volume attachments and makes the creation of pods using the CephCsi PVC fast.
                        **WARNING** It's highly discouraged to use this for RWO volumes. for RBD PVC it can cause data corruption,
                        csi-addons operations like Reclaimspace and PVC Keyrotation will also not be supported if set to false
                        since we'll have no VolumeAttachments to determine which node the PVC is mounted on.
                        Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/103305) for more details.

                                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.


                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.


                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                                    properties:
                                      volumeClaimTemplate:

                                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                  provisioner.
                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards

                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.

                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                              Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                              This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                    can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                                    Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                    This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                    Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                    Default value is 0.
                                    Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                    that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                    can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                    The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                    pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                    on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                    reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                    pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                    Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                    daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                    so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                    cause evictions during disruption.

                                    This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0
                                    Default value is 1.
                                    Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                    that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                    can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                    starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                    up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                    it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                    70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                    the update.

                                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.


                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.


                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                                    properties:
                                      volumeClaimTemplate:

                                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                          to the PVC after it has been created.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                  provisioner.
                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards

                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.

                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
