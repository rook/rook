description: A simple library chart to share content between Rook's charts
version: 0.0.1
type: library

# Developer notes:
# - all templates must start with an underscore, or Helm won't detect them
# - library definitions should be named 'library.*'
# - library definitions should avoid conditional logic unless necessary
# - templates named with '_cluster-*' are for CephCluster-scoped resources
# - cluster-scoped definitions are named 'library.cluster.*'
# - prefer templates that are named to their purpose (prefer avoiding '_helper.tpl')
# - prefer combining features that can be enabled/disabled together (e.g., monitoring or PSP) into
#   feature templates rather than spreading the content among lower-level templates like
#   '_*rolebinding.tpl'

# Note on Rook's use of this chart as a chart dependency:
# The library chart is a dependency of Rook's other charts; however, including the library chart in
# the 'charts/' dir of dependent charts via a symlink does not require using
# 'helm dependency update'. This is beneficial because Helm creates a tar file that changes each
# time 'helm dependency update' is called, meaning we cannot use git to determine if someone failed
# to update the chart upon submitting a pull request. A helm blog reports that symlinks work as
# intended but are warned about because symlinked files could be sensitive, but we are just linking
# our library and not anything outside of this repo.
