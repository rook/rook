# Linters

This directory contains linters that can be used to check Gnostic models.

Linters are plugins that generate no files but instead return messages
in their responses. Each message can include a level, an identifier, text,
and a key path in an API description associated with that message.
Messages are collected by gnostic and written to a common output file,
allowing multiple linter plugins to be invoked in a single gnostic
run.

The following invocation runs the `gnostic-lint-paths` and 
`gnostic-lint-descriptions` plugins and writes their messages
to a file named `lint.pb`.

```
% gnostic examples/v2.0/yaml/petstore.yaml --lint-paths --lint-descriptions --messages-out=lint.pb
```

Message files can be displayed using the `report-messages` tool in the `apps` directory.
